Since this addon is still heavily WIP, you can also clone this repository into Blender's addons folders too keep it up-to-date more easily (make sure you then Install it into blender through \_\_init\_\_.py file).


This repository also includes textures for default materials. When dowloading zip version of it they won't be included. Make sure you replace them with your own if you want to use that feature (or install it through git clone as explained above).

# How to use

Use property tabs (mesh, lights, collections, materials); search for "trackmania" so relevant properties are highlighted.
