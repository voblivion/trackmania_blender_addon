Bumper: makes the car bump a bit
Bumper2: makes the car bump a lot
Cruise: makes the car maintain its speed
ForceAcceleration: disables breaking until next Reset block or next checkpoint
Fragile: makes the car sensitive to hard bumps and crashes, making it harder to handle and accelerate the more damages it takes. Only gets back to normal with a Reset Block
FreeWheeling: entirely stops the engine until next Reset block or next checkpoint
NoBrakes: disables the car brakes
NoGrip: comparable to ice, but way less handling and no drift mechanic until next Reset block or next checkpoint
None: no gameplay effect (this is the default value for all game materials)
NoSteering: disables steering until next Reset block or next checkpoint
ReactorBoost: activates flames at the sides of the wheels that push the car upwards or downwards for some time or until next Reset block (direction of ReactorBoost is along Z-axis: towards positive Z is ReactorBoost Up and towards negative is ReactorBoost Down)
ReactorBoost2: same effect as ReactorBoost, but stronger
Reset: disables any ongoing gameplay effects
SlowMotion: slows down the behaviour of the car (but not the timer) for some time or until next Reset block
Turbo: "yellow turbo" blocks, sudden burst of acceleration (direction of Turbo is North / along Z-axis)
Turbo2: "red turbo" blocks, stronger burst of acceleration (direction of Turbo2 is North / along the Z-axis)
